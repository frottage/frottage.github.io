      <description>Hmm sounds OK Heracleitus called the Universal Principle (των απαντων αρχη) Intellectual Fire (πυρ νοερον), and said that the sphere surrounding us and reaching to the Moon was filled with evil, but beyond the Moon-sphere it was purer.

Perhaps this is to say that most of Creation isn&amp;rsquo;t corrupted. But around Earth, it kinda is. Perhaps the corruption hasn&amp;rsquo;t spread far from Earth.

      <description>Links Describing Melee&amp;rsquo;s Paintings with AlephAlpha // Bodacious Blog Imagining Melee&amp;rsquo;s artworks with DALL-E-2 // Bodacious Blog &amp;lt;3 I use DALLE to imagine my descriptions of Melee&amp;rsquo;s paintings. There is a prompt limit, so the descriptions could be improved using Imagism. However, I&amp;rsquo;m using the opening paragraph of each original description.
These generations are cool but so far nowhere accurate enough to capture the nuance of Melee&amp;rsquo;s original artworks.
