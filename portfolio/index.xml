      <description>Blog https://semiosis.github.io/posts/the-most-surreal-day/ Water, fire and light I bought the glass pendent so I can put Melee&amp;rsquo;s paintings in it to keep her close to me.
I was wearing all black that day and the pendant with the same Gankyl (The wheel of Joy; coloured in with fire, water and light), that I wore when I met the Holy Spirit.
Too much synchronicity Some birds came up to me. I bought a cheese roll for them I gave away all my money Chen&amp;rsquo;s doppelganger Caleb turned up and I talked to him about the Holy Spirit I told him about my meeting with the subconscious.</description>

      <description>Hmm sounds OK Heracleitus called the Universal Principle (œÑœâŒΩ Œ±œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ Œ±œÅœáŒ∑) Intellectual Fire (œÄœÖœÅ ŒΩŒøŒµœÅŒøŒΩ), and said that the sphere surrounding us and reaching to the Moon was filled with evil, but beyond the Moon-sphere it was purer.

Perhaps this is to say that most of Creation isn&amp;rsquo;t corrupted. But around Earth, it kinda is. Perhaps the corruption hasn&amp;rsquo;t spread far from Earth.

      <description>Links Describing Melee&amp;rsquo;s Paintings with AlephAlpha // Bodacious Blog Imagining Melee&amp;rsquo;s artworks with DALL-E-2 // Bodacious Blog &amp;lt;3 I use DALLE to imagine my descriptions of Melee&amp;rsquo;s paintings. There is a prompt limit, so the descriptions could be improved using Imagism. However, I&amp;rsquo;m using the opening paragraph of each original description.
These generations are cool but so far nowhere accurate enough to capture the nuance of Melee&amp;rsquo;s original artworks.

      <description>Water, fire and light This night, as I was walking home, I passed upwards through the forest. Upon entering the forest, my vibrational energy started increasing.
It&amp;rsquo;s raining but I&amp;rsquo;m warm. I stopped, looking up the path. Behind me is single street lamp. Large rain drops dripped from the branches above. I exhaled. My warm breath went out in front of me in a cloud, illuminated by the street lamp behind me, and the large rain drops glistened in the background.</description>
