This morning as I was waking up, the Star of David appeared in my mind.
I want to learn more about it.
Reading material:

                                  My dream At 5am this morning I had a dream of perhaps 1000 people sitting on the ground within a building, all facing the same direction. I myself was sitting between two friends of mine, Simon and Megan. Simon asked me for a red fruit burst - Strawberry Flavour, which I gladly handed to him. I then began speaking in tongues. I also believe I felt bubbles of living water through my light body.

                                  The Gospel of Truth is not a gospel in the sense of an account of the works of Jesus of Nazareth, but is better understood as a homily.
The text is generally considered by scholars one of the best written texts in the whole Nag Hammadi collection, considering its worth highly as both a great literary work and a gnostic exegesis on several gospels, canonical and otherwise.
The writing is thought to cite or allude to the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and John, as well as 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Hebrews, 1 John and the Book of Revelation.

https://semiosis.github.io/creation/ https://github.com/demioergos The word means literally a public worker, demioergós, demiourgós, and was originally used to designate any craftsman plying his craft or trade for the use of the public.
Soon, however, technítes and other words began to be used to designate the common artisan while demiurge was set aside for the Great Artificer or Fabricator, the Architect of the universe.
At first the words toû kósmou were added to distinguish the great Workman from others, but gradually demiourgós became the technical term for the Maker of heaven and earth.

                                  The prayer is this: That we make it to the end and stand on top. And I think the sea turns to glass.
My instinct is that the sea of the spiritual waters solidifies once the corruption has been removed, and those that learned to stand in the river now stand on top of the sea.
Repentance is like learning to swim, and learning to stand in the river, and to stay on top of it.

Journal: The Most Surreal Day // Bodacious Blog It&rsquo;s a syzygy because the same day I first noticed the Kingdom of Heaven I see Melee at the end (I think it was real), as if I had to relinquish all ties before I was allowed. There&rsquo;s only building up from here.

Water, fire and light I bought the glass pendent so I can put Melee&rsquo;s paintings in it to keep her close to me.
I was wearing all black that day and the pendant with the same Gankyl (The wheel of Joy; coloured in with fire, water and light), that I wore when I met the Holy Spirit.
Too much synchronicity Some birds came up to me.

                                  Water, fire and light This night, as I was walking home, I passed upwards through the forest. Upon entering the forest, my vibrational energy started increasing.
It&rsquo;s raining but I&rsquo;m warm. I stopped, looking up the path. Behind me is single street lamp. Large rain drops dripped from the branches above. I exhaled. My warm breath went out in front of me in a cloud, illuminated by the street lamp behind me, and the large rain drops glistened in the background.

                                  Summary The Synaxis of the Glorious and All- Praiseworthy Twelve Apostles of Christ appears to be an ancient Feast.
The Church honors each of the Twelve Apostles on separate dates during the year, and has established a general commemoration for all of them on the day after the commemoration of the Glorious and First-Ranked among the Apostles Peter and Paul.
