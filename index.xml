      <description>My dream ID Date Lucidity Prophetic Holy Spirit Surreal 36 Aug 4, 2022 2 ? ? ✓ Description:
Collecting things I need were buried in the sand in a line at the top of the beach. 20 or so small things: Pen Watch Wallet etc. For some reason these things were buried in a line I was right at the very end. Next to me was Melee, I think standing at a door saying come on lets go, hurry up I was on the last bit but she literally about to leave without me Did I need all these things?</description>

      <description>Links:
https://semiosis.github.io/creation/ https://github.com/demioergos The word means literally a public worker, demioergós, demiourgós, and was originally used to designate any craftsman plying his craft or trade for the use of the public.
Soon, however, technítes and other words began to be used to designate the common artisan while demiurge was set aside for the Great Artificer or Fabricator, the Architect of the universe.
At first the words toû kósmou were added to distinguish the great Workman from others, but gradually demiourgós became the technical term for the Maker of heaven and earth.</description>

      <description>The prayer is this: That we make it to the end and stand on top. And I think the sea turns to glass.
My instinct is that the sea of the spiritual waters solidifies once the corruption has been removed, and those that learned to stand in the river now stand on top of the sea.
Repentance is like learning to swim, and learning to stand in the river, and to stay on top of it.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the metaverse here, not my faith; It&amp;rsquo;s a heavy burden to keep this separate in my mind. Hyperuranion (Platonic realm) This is place in heaven where all ideas of real things are collected together.
Following in the designs of creation, in building the metaverse, this is where inspiration takes place for creation.

      <description>Two perfect syzygies on each end of July. At the second half of 2022. I entered &amp;lsquo;Heaven&amp;rsquo; on the perfect day.

I was wearing all black that day and the pendant with the same Gankyl (The wheel of Joy; coloured in with fire, water and light), that I wore when I met the Holy Spirit.
Too much synchronicity Some birds came up to me. I bought a cheese roll for them I gave away all my money Chen&amp;rsquo;s doppelganger Caleb turned up and I talked to him about the Holy Spirit I told him about my meeting with the subconscious.</description>

      <description>Hmm sounds OK Heracleitus called the Universal Principle (των απαντων αρχη) Intellectual Fire (πυρ νοερον), and said that the sphere surrounding us and reaching to the Moon was filled with evil, but beyond the Moon-sphere it was purer.
http://gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/grsm%5Fsimon%5Fmagus.htm#FNanchor%5F97
Perhaps this is to say that most of Creation isn&amp;rsquo;t corrupted. But around Earth, it kinda is. Perhaps the corruption hasn&amp;rsquo;t spread far from Earth.

      <description>Water, fire and light This night, as I was walking home, I passed upwards through the forest. Upon entering the forest, my vibrational energy started increasing.
It&amp;rsquo;s raining but I&amp;rsquo;m warm. I stopped, looking up the path. Behind me is single street lamp. Large rain drops dripped from the branches above. I exhaled. My warm breath went out in front of me in a cloud, illuminated by the street lamp behind me, and the large rain drops glistened in the background.</description>

      <description>Hmm sounds OK Heracleitus called the Universal Principle (των απαντων αρχη) Intellectual Fire (πυρ νοερον), and said that the sphere surrounding us and reaching to the Moon was filled with evil, but beyond the Moon-sphere it was purer.[97]

Perhaps this is to say that most of Creation isn&amp;rsquo;t corrupted. But around Earth, it kinda is. Perhaps the corruption hasn&amp;rsquo;t spread far from Earth.
DALL-E Scriptures 1 Corinthians 15:33 33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</description>
